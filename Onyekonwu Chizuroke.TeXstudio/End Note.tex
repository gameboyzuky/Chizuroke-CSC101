	\item Being an aspiring software engineer as well as game developer, my pick of the bunch was not a very difficult one for me to decide.
\end{itemize} 
	\paragraph{C++ as well as Java are both widely used languages for game development. }
	\paragraph{Whereas C++ can compile all C programs virtually allowing the developer to reuse C software, Java programs run faster than C++. They are alos quite basic and also easier to write than C which is basically an expert-only language.}
