	\section{WHY C++?} 
	C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high performance applications. C++ is one of the world’s most popular programming languages that gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory. C++ IS fun and easy to learn. (from W3 schools)
	\section{WHAT IS C++}
	C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs. C++ is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop operating systems, browsers, games etc.
	\section{BRIEF HISTORY OF C++}
	C++ was developed by\emph{Bjarne Stroustruf} at Bell laboratories over a period starting in 1979. Since C++ is an attempt to add object-oriented features( plus other improvements) to C, earlier it was called “C with objectsLKRF”. As the language develop, Stroustrup named it as C++ on 1983.
	C++ was made available outside Bell laboratories in 1985. The first commercial C++ compiler, C front, was released in 1985. It was only a front-end compiler for C.
	The American National Standard institute(ANSI) formed a committee for (precise description of computer language) C++ in 1989. The first draft standards were published in in 1995.
