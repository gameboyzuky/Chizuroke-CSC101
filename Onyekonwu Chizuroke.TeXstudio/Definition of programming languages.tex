 \title{\underline{\textbf{WHAT ARE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES?}}}
 \maketitle
 Before we delve into the history of programming languages, It is important to understand the concept of programming languages.
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Programming Language is a formal language comprising of a set of strings that produce various kinds of machine output. Simply put, a computer programming language is a language used to write computer programs. This involves the computer performing series of computation or algorithm(From Wikipedia) 
 \item From my personal understanding;  In general, a programming language refers to languages that can be used to convey specific instructions that direct the behavior of machines.
\end{itemize} 
 \paragraph{However, as authors vary, so do their mindsets. Some describe programming language as a subset of computer language. This is to say that not all computer languages are utilized in programming. For instance, markup languages are usually referred to as computer languages so as to heavily point out that they are not meant to be used for the purpose of programming.}
 \paragraph{It is important to note that thousands of different programming languages have been created, and more are being created every year. This is to show that, while there are programming experts, no one actually knows everything when it comes to programming.}
